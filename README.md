# responsive-portfolio

SUMMARY: A portfolio web-page with pages for a basic bio, contact information, and gallery of relevant projects.

BASIC USE: 

About - containing the page owner's bio, this page can be reached via the About Me option in the navigation bar, or by clicking on the owner's name. Though this may seem redundant, it is actually thematically complete as (1.) the navigation bar would be incomplete with only 2/3 of the pages available, and (2.) one would think that the owner name would be linked to more owner information.

Contact - a page that allows a user to contact the page owner by filling out basic contact information. 
  
  NOTE: since this is merely a demonstration page, no email address has actually been tied to the page. Thus, a submission will return a           404 error.  This can be changed once the page is meant to go live.
  NOTE: this page also has basic input validation. Though it is not linked to any services that can test for whether the address actually           exists, it does require simple email formatting and will alert the user of this error. There are also character caps on all                 sections to prevent submissions from becoming too verbose.
  
Portfolio - this page is the centerpiece of the website, a gallery that links to as many projects as the page owner chooses via easily duplicated boxes. To access the project, the user simply needs to click on the label band spanning the image, and a hyperlink will take them to the proper location.

  NOTE: as there is no actual owner for this page yet, the hyperlinks will take you to a variety of fun-filled videos. Enjoy.
  
KEY FEATURES: 
Mobile Responsiveness - this page uses media queries to scale up-down as needed, making it visibly aesthetic from desktop monitors to cellphone screens. To wit, an easter egg has been planted in when a certain screen-size is reached.
